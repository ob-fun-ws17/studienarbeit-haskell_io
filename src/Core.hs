-- | The coreModule is the core of the Programm, it handles core functionality.
-- this functionallity is in reading file indexes of directories, comapring the files read, and deleting or moving files.
-- to be more concrete, the core reads (and filters) a directory containing so called jpeg files and one containing so called raw files
-- then it comapares the two lists (jpeg list and raw list). in order to find all raw files, that have no matching jpeg file. (called differences)
-- in the last step, the core, depending on the settings, deletes or moves all differences.
-- Info: For simplicitie's sake the files matching the rawEnding of the settings are
-- calleds raw files and the files matching the jpegEnding are called jpeg files even they could have any ending and could be files of any type.
